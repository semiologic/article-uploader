Lets you bypass WordPress' editor when it stops working as expected.


== Description ==

The Article Uploader plugin for WordPress lets you bypass WordPress' editor when it stops working as expected -- which is frequent when you're pasting complicated copy, since WordPress destroys forms and scripts as it reformats html.

Specifically, it allows you to:

- turn off WP's rich text editor and content reformatting features on individual entries.
- upload HTML and text files in place of using the WP editor.

When uploading HTML files, it replaces your entry's content with everything found in between your <body> and </body> tags. It literally does so -- complete with any html error you may have left behind.

When uploading plain text files such as those purchased on private label content sites, paragraphs will be added automatically and the rich text editor will remain turned on.
